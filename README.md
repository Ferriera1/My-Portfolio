# My-Portfolio

Creatied a wireframe for the project using paint tools to reflect what direction I'd like the page to flow.
Created the index.html and style.css files in the CLI using the git commands
Added profile image
Noticed I had 2 images and created an image folder as a home for them
Added the rest of my HTML and started fixing my CSS so that it looks a little closer to my wireframe
Created a Project.html so that I could link my images to it
