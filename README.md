# My-Portfolio

Creatied a wireframe for the project using paint tools to reflect what direction I'd like the page to flow.
Created the index.html and style.css files in the CLI using the git commands
Added profile image
Noticed I had 2 images and created an image folder as a home for them
Added the rest of my HTML and started fixing my CSS so that it looks a little closer to my wireframe
Created a Project.html so that I could link my images to it
tried to fix my main tag so that the aside and section tags are beside each other 
Semi fixed the spacing between the contact me and Projects sections
Cleaned up the css a bit and fixed some spacing
linked my projects id in the nav bar properly
